# HMTL5 media element control plugin for Shower

Plugin for the [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower/) presentation engine.

Support playing all HTML5 media (audio, video) elements on a slide on 'next' slide events.
* Elements are played sequentially, one per event.
* Elements reset played state on slide (re)activation or slidemodeexit.
* Autoplay is supported through <code>data-autoplay</code> (there's no queueing or scheduling of multiple autoplay elements though, just as with native HTML)
